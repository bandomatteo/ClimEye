# ClimEye
The project analyzes video footage from static webcams to detect weather conditions, focusing on elements like clouds and trees. The system interprets environmental factors, such as wind, based on movement. Using video signal processing, it aims to improve real-time weather monitoring by automating the recognition of atmospheric phenomena.
